64 (in   2025   the   main   storage   facility   will   need   to   be   replaced,   hence   the   higher   investment).   From   2029   onwards,   dividends   will   increase   at   a   rate   of   2%   a   year   forever.    The   interest   rate   is   6%.
(a)      Use   the      Gordon      growth      formula    (See    equation    1)    to      calculate   the   value   that   the   factory   will   have   in   2028   after   paying   dividends   (i.e.   the   value   not   including   the   value   of the   dividends   it   will   pay   in   2028).
V = r - g/d1 (1)(b) Compute the present value of   the entire inﬁnite stream of   dividends that starts in 2019.
Question 2: Credit Constraints 
A   two-period   world   exists.   A   ﬁrm’s   production   function   is   given   by
F(K,   L) =   At   Kα L1-α 
where   At      can   have   diferent   values   in   each   period.       In   each   period,    the   ﬁrm      can   hire labor   in   a   competitive   labor   market   at   the   same   wage   w,   which   the   ﬁrm   perceives   as constant.    Unfortunately,   there   isn’t   a   market   for   renting   capital:    the   ﬁrm   can   only   use capital   it   owns.   If the ﬁrm   possesses   K units   of capital   and   decides to   employ   L   workers, its   earnings   will   be   F(K,   L) → wL.      Initially,   the   ﬁrm   has   K1    units   of   capital   in   the   ﬁrst   period. No depreciation occurs. At the end of period 1, the firm can procure capital for period   2   either   by   utilizing   its   earnings   or   by   borrowing.         All   loans   must   be   repaid   in period   2,   and   the   interest   rate   is   r.      Earnings   can   also   be   used   to   distribute   dividends   to shareholders   in   period   1.    The   utmost   amount   lenders   are   willing   to   provide   to   the   ﬁrm is   b.
(a)   Formulate   the   ﬁrm’s   challenge   in   deciding   the   number   of   workers   to   employ   in   each   period.    Recognize   that   this   issue   can   be   addressed   period   by   period,   considering   Kt    as constant.   Derive an expression for the pro代 写ECON3102 Tutorial 07 - Week 8Matlab
代做程序编程语言ﬁts   of   a   ﬁrm   in   period   t   that   accepts   its   capital   stock   Kt   as   constant   and   determines   the   amount   of labor   to   employ,   i.e.,   for
           ω(Kt) = max F(Kt, L) - wL 
L
(b)   Illustrate   the   ﬁrm’s   problem   in   deciding   the   dividend   amount,   borrowing   quantity,   and   investment   level.
(c) If b   =   ∞   , prove that the   ideal   investment   quantity   is   inﬂuenced   by   A2    but   not   by   A1   .   Elaborate.
(d)   Assuming   b   =   0,   demonstrate   that   when   A1      is   adequately   high,   then   the   optimal   investment   level   aligns   with   part      (c).      Determine   the   least   level   of   A1      for   this   scenario   and   label   it   A1(*)   .    Argue   that   when   A1    < A1(*), the investment is inﬂuenced by A1 . Please elucidate.
(e)   Suppose   A1    < A1(*) . How does the ﬁrm respond to a rise in A2 ? How does an increase in b afect the ﬁrm’s decisions? Please explain.
Question 3: Aggregate Investment with Risk 
The   world   lasts   two   periods.    The   aggregate   production   technology   for   period   2   is   given   by:
F(K,   L) =   AKα L1-α K   is   the   aggregate   capital   stock   in   period   2   and   L is   the   labor   force,   which   is   exogenous   and   normalized   to   L   =   1.    Period   2   is   the   end   of   the   world,   so   capital   depreciates   fully   (δ =   1)   and the representative household   will   consume   F(K,   L)   =   AKα L1-α .    The utility   function   is   u(c)   =   log(c).      A   is   a   random   variable,   which   can   take   two   possible   values: AH =1+ ϑ or AL = 1 - ϑ, with   equal   probability.    The   interest   rate   between   periods      1
Now   consider   the   following   investment   project:    investing   an   additional   unit   in   period   1   to   obtain   an   additional   unit   of capital   in   period   2.
(a)   What      is   the      dividend   produced   by   the      marginal      unit   of   capital?       Express      it      as      a   function   of the   aggregate   capital   stock   K   and   realized   productivity   A.
(b)   Suppose   ϑ = 0.    For what value   of K   is   the   net   present   value   of   additional   investment   exactly   zero?
(c)      Now      suppose      ϑ    >      0.       For    what    value      of   K   is   the      net      present   value      of   additional   investment   exactly   zero?    (Hints:   Use   equation   2   to   guide   your   answer).

(d)   How   does   K   depend   on   ϑ?   Explain.
